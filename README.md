This repository contains code samples and techniques referenced in my Medium blog post, ["Exception Filters in C#"](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/exception-filters-in-c-780b87c62758). This post and repository focus on understanding exception filters in C#, how they improve error handling, and their practical applications.

## Overview
In this blog post, I discuss exception filters, a feature in C# that allows developers to specify conditions under which an exception is handled. Exception filters provide a more granular approach to error handling, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of your code.
